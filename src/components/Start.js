            <p>Unless the title isn't clear, this combines the fill-in-the-blanks word game of Mad Libs, but you use the white cards from Cards Against Humanity to fill in the blank. It's not exactly the riddle of the Sphinx.</p>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>You will be presented with 10 cards. You will be given a entry (verb, noun, adjective, etc) that you will need to pick which card you want to use with that. Obviously it won't make sense, but that's the point, stupid.</p>
